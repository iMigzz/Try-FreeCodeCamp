I’ve always been curious about how software applications work — how they’re built, how they solve real problems, and how they’re shaping the future. With this courage and curiosity in tech, I decided to explore this world on my own. That’s when I discovered freeCodeCamp, a free platform that opened the doors for me to learn coding, web development, and more — all from scratch.

Through consistent effort, late nights, and small wins, I slowly built my knowledge and confidence. What started as simple curiosity has grown into a solid foundation of skills that I can proudly carry into today’s digital world. And I’m just getting started.
